- Added TestNoDebugRestart and TestNoDebugStdIO.
- Added member access through members marked with `DebuggerBrowsableState.RootHidden` in expression evaluation.

#### Changed
- Updated tree-sitter version to 0.27.0.
- Updated diagnostics version to v10.0.745401.
- Added CI step to build `libdbgshim` from a pinned [`dotnet/diagnostics`](https://github.com/dotnet/diagnostics) master revision ([`tools/update-diagnostics.sh`](tools/update-diagnostics.sh), `diagnostics_ref` workflow input).
- Minimized the tree-sitter C# grammar to expression-evaluation constructs, shrinking parser.c and binary/memory usage.
- Renamed TestTracePoint to TestLogpoints to match VS Code terminology.
- Updated float and double value display to the shortest round-trip representation, matching the C# default floating-point formatting (e.g. `9.9` instead of `9.8999996`, `1E+09` instead of `1e+09`).
- Updated object display to escape special characters in the overridden `ToString()` output, matching string value escaping.
- Reworked attach to the `RegisterForRuntimeStartup` callback flow, replacing the `EnumerateCLRs`-based runtime discovery.
- Reworked static member resolution in expression evaluation to walk static members through metadata instead of allocating a type object via function evaluation.
- Updated metadata enumeration loops to explicitly check for `S_OK` instead of `SUCCEEDED()`.
- Reworked constructor token collection to enumerate `.ctor` and `.cctor` methods by name, avoiding per-method name and attribute checks.

#### Removed
- Removed unused code.
- Removed the type object cache used for static member resolution.

#### Fixed
- Fixed constructor display in stack traces (`.ctor` and `.cctor`).
- Fixed SetVariable to accept non-negative `long` constant expressions for `ulong` variables (implicit constant expression conversions, ECMA-334).
- Fixed breakpoint on first line of method nested in constructor being moved to constructor's declaration line.
- Fixed pause selecting a thread without user code as the last stopped thread; now the first thread with a valid user source location is preferred.
- Fixed crash in `CheckBreakpointHit()` when `setBreakpoints`/`setFunctionBreakpoints` mutates breakpoint containers while the debuggee is running.
- Fixed "Innermost exception" in exception description to report the last exception in the InnerException chain instead of the direct inner exception.
- Fixed stack trace when stopped in a catch block showing throw-site frames that had already been unwound by the exception in addition to the catch frames.
- Fixed assignment for nullable values and ensured Nullable<T> storage is cleared.
- Fixed indexer lookup when arguments have array element types.
- Fixed indexer properties being listed as regular members when walking object members.
- Fixed element access evaluation to resolve indexers by property metadata instead of the `get_Item` name heuristic, enabling indexers with non-standard getter names (e.g. `string[0]` uses `Chars`).
- Fixed Launch Request handling of optional `env` and `sourceFileMap` options: switched from `at()` to `find()`.
- Fixed cleanup ordering between process exit and terminate.
- Fixed swapped I1/U1 aliases in signature parsing.
- Fixed static parameterized properties (static indexers) being listed as regular members when walking static members.
- Fixed infinite walk on circular references through members marked with `DebuggerBrowsableState.RootHidden`.
- Fixed async `Main` entry breakpoint setup to actually check the enclosing class of the `<Main>d__N` state machine type (the check was always false, so a state machine from an unrelated class could be picked when several classes declare `Main`).
